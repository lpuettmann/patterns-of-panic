## Data

There are two datasets in this repository:

- *pp_quarterly.csv*: Quarterly dataset
- *pp_monthly.csv*: Monthly dataset

Email me if you are interested in higher-frequency (weekly, daily) indicators.

Both datasets are in comma separated files and contain the following variables:

- `year`: Year as number.
- `quarter/month`: Quarter or month as number.
- `date`: Contains date as string.
- `newspapers`: Either uses "all" newspapers or leaves one out at a time. 
- `mood`: Can be "negative", "neutral" or "positive".
- `detrending`: Either no detrending or one of three methods (on the level of newspapers, before averaging).
- `val`: The numerical indicator value.

The baseline indicator takes "all" newspapers, has mood "negative" and uses detrending "none". For further explanations and for easier to use Excel files that only contain the baseline versions of the data, see [here](http://policyuncertainty.com/financial_stress.html).

## Use

I'm providing some [codes](https://github.com/lpuettmann/patterns-of-panic/blob/master/explore_pp.R) here to plot the baseline indicator:
